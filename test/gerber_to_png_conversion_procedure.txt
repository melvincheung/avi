[gerber layers]
in gerbv:
convert layers (e.g pad, white ink, drill) to svg

in Inkscape:
convert .svg file to .png or .bmp

in matlab:
rotate the pcb board to correct orientation
for pad layer, select the suitable color (a mixture of some colors) to represent pad

current problem:
- the sizes of gerber layers after conversion are different. how to deal with it?
- any way to simplify these tedious procedures?
